Inventory Tracker for Sportswear Distributor

This web app uses Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and SQL to create a fake database for our sportswear distributor. Specifically, we used Flask, a Python library to connect to the HTML front end. This management system tracks which products are being sent, and gives the opportunity to the administrator to add customers to the system if needed. It also keeps track of the payment method. 

Using the cx_Oracle library, we connect to the SQL database and are able to pull and post information back to it. This front end abstracts complex queries away from the end user, so they can easily interact with our technology.
